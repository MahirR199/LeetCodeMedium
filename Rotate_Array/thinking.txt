The rotating algorithms takes the idea that 1 part of the array will be shifted to the front and the other to the back
this will be divided by the k which is the amount the numbers shift by. To shift to the right we first reverse the array
then we reverse the start of the array to the amount it shifts by (start = 0, end = k-1)
then reverse the next section of the array that wasnt reversed (start = k, end= len(nums)-1)

for the case where the k is greater than len(nums), we k mod len(nums)
