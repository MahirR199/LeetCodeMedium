Buy low sell high
go along the list and have condition while pointer < len(list)-1
as we need to compare the next number to the current number (avoid out of bounds error)
first we compare the next number and keep incrementing pointer while the next number is <= then the number at pointer
after it fails we make lo = to the number at pointer
next we compare the next number and keep incrementing pointer while the next number is >= then the number at pointer
after the condition fails we make hi = to the number at pointer
calculate profit and the while loop backtracks
